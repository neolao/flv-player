FLV-Player JQuery plugin
========================

I was looking to replace a player for .flv files that seems to no longer be supported. I forked http://github.com/neolao/flv-player, so that I would have the source files as well, as that project was a few years old. It still works fine though, so I made a static web project in eclipse and pointed it at the template_js directory. Then I added index.html js/flv-player.js, css/flv-player.css, and a static image to images/play.svg. The sample videos are US department of labor job videos.
